# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **NAME**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/lake-spangle-persimmon?path=README.md%3A86%3A22)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

No, I didn't use any outside resources, just the directions given. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

One of the challenges that I frequently ran into was my app not working as desired. 
For example, when I implemented the onmousedown function on the buttons, all the buttons 
played the same sound. Tracing back my work, I realized that the problem was that I didn't
change the values for the "startTone". 

Looking back I realized that this mistake was caused by my ego and lack of patience during the moment. 
Because I had some experience with these 3 coding languages, I thought that this assignment would not
be difficult at all and because of this, rushed through. This humbling experience reminded me that programmers 
must put 110% focus into their work at all times, no matter how important or unimportant it may seem. I understood
that every piece of code I wrote is essential not only to my work and this internship, but more importantly, my overall 
goal of becoming a prestigous developer that puts maximum effort into every project. 

From then on, I read every instruction carefully with upmost focus and coded each line with the intention of both understanding 
and expanding upon it. Although mistakes are inevitable during coding, with maximum effort, I was able to take the time to 
acknowlege these mistakes and learn from them.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

This submission inspired me to think creatively about the unlimited possibilites of web development. For example, 
my grandma has dementia and coding this game could possibly allow her improve her memory. This brought me to the question of
How can web development be used to help people with with disabilites? What are examples of this in the world
today? When thinking about web development, I usually picture e-commerce stores, blogs, or social media posts, but this 
assginment made me ponder about the how learning web development can be used to create impact among our own community. I would love
to learn more about the role of web development in the world today because I want to be someone who utlizes the skill of web 
development with the primary motive not to make tons of money but to transform society and help others. 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would like to try this game with my grandma and change it to her liking. In order to accomplish this, 
I would need to broaden my knowledge of these 3 coding languages. I would like to style it to be 
more appealing and fun, adjust the difficulites of the patterns, and possibly change the sound. The 
background would be changed to her favorite color and if the game is too easy, I'll increase the speed of the 
sounds playing and prolong the patterns. Additionally, I plan to adjust the tones of the buttons such that 
the correct pattern produces a sound that is similar to her favorite tune. Just thinking about the possibilites 
from completing this one assignment makes me excited to learn many more possibilites that I can learn from 
mastering the skill of web development.
